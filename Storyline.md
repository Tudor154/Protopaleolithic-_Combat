The equatorial forest of Africa, 2 000 375 BC

The equatorial forest of Africa is a paradise for humans. However, due to the cooling of the climate, the oceans do not evaporate as much water as before, and therefore, in many 
territories, not so much rain falls. Therefore, the area of equatorial forests is shrinking. Thus, over time, many inhabited territories have been transformed from forest to 
savanna.

Some people have begun to migrate from the savanna, which is a harsher environment, to the equatorial forests, which are more friendly. But there they find natives who do not 
want to share the territory with them. Thus, conflicts begin.
